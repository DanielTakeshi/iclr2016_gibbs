# iclr2016_gibbs
Repository for the ICLR 2016 paper submission.

The data_and_scripts directory contains data and scripts needed to generate the figures in the paper.

The older_figures contains older information (figures and other stuff) that we didn't include in the paper.

Note to self: delete the data before making public (and figure out how to prevent people from taking older versions).

Questions? seita@berkeley.edu
